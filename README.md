Here first i imported the data into power query and cleaned the data using some methods.
Later i uploded the data into the excel.
I have created pivot tables for summarizing the data as.
Sum of operating profit gender wise.
Sum of operating profit city wise.
Sum of operating profit year wise.
Sum of operating profit reatailer wise
Sum of operating profit product wise
Also added some kpis in sheet 7.
Finally made charts for visualizations using pivot charts.
